# Shapes


## Shapegraph

This section addresses some uses of SHACL for GaiaCatalog.  Be sure you have installed
[pyshacl](https://pypi.org/project/pyshacl/) first.   


```json
"@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/"
  }
```

since the original context has some issues around the resolution of 
the context name space. 

We can use the pyshacl tool to test this.   A command like 

```bash
pyshacl -s gaiaShape1.ttl -sf turtle -df json-ld -f table example.json
```

will test example.json using the shape graph in gaiaShape1.ttl and 
provide the results in a table format. Example of the output can be seen below.  

Note, this shape file was intentionally designed to return some warnings.  Just as 
a demonstration.   It may well be that none of these _warnings_ are of concern. 
Once we have a working process flow, we can work to generate the constraints in the
shape file that are relevant.  

For example, it does look for a variable _latitude_ and _longitude_ in this case. 
Which this test passes.  If you remove or find an example without these, you should
see those errors raised as well.  

Errors can have three levels: WARNING, VIOLATION and RECOMMENDED.  So we can design the shape file with these various levels in mind.  

```bash
(.venv) ➜  shapeGraphs git:(master) ✗ pyshacl -s gaiaShape1.ttl -sf turtle -df json-ld -f table example.json
