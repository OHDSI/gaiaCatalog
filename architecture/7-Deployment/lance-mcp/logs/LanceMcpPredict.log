Although AQI includes all available pollutant measurements, you should be aware that many areas have monitoring stations for some, but not all, of the pollutants. Each row of the AQI Report lists summary values for one year for one county or CBSA. The summary values include both qualitative measures (days of the year having good air quality, for example) and descriptive statistics (median AQI value, for example).\\n\\nSummary statistics for the current year are incomplete because data are still being reported and quality assured.
