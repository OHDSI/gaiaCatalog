# Notes

Developed a use case around the gaiaCatalog.  The gaiaCatalog contains all the materials to build the gaiaCatalog containers for use in the OHDSI/GIS toolchain as a part of the Information on Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) organization.  See https://github.com/OHDSI/gaiaCatalog

For this a mapping use case based around the use of R2RML and RML mapping languages.   In this use case, data from census and governmental geospatial resources are integrated and mapped to RDF types and properties.  

These resources are located: 

The goal then is to represent this specific mapping use case to a conceptual representation based on a modification of the SSSOM mapping representation.     We will use this use case, and others, to explore this representation in this conceptual model.  

Additionally the OHDSI work will express the discovery metadata aligned to the CDIF Discovery profile and leverage the CDIF Mapping profile as it evolves.  The goal is to leverage the CDIF patterns within the ODHSI effort to facilitate interoperability with other clinic trails efforts (Ask Jay to review this)
