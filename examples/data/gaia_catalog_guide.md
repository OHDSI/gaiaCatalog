- Dataset
  - Standard properties include name, description, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished, expires, license, [citation](https://schema.org/citation), version, [keywords](https://schema.org/keywords), [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique), [measurementMethod](https://schema.org/measurementMethod), creator, funder and provider
  - mainEntity
    - Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork
    - Has a controlled vocabulary: "Place", "Person", "Household", "Establishment", "Entangled"
  - includedInDataCatalog
    - A data catalog which contains this dataset
    - Our data catalog is named the GaiaCatalog
  - isBasedOn
    - A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaptation
    - Can take the form of an array of resources
    - See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#indicating-a-source-dataset-schemaisbasedon-and-provwasderivedfrom) for an example
  - subjectOf
    - A [Claim](https://schema.org/Claim) about this Thing
    - Think of the Claim(s) a Dataset makes as its hypotheses. A claim has...
      - An appearance that indicates an occurrence of a Claim in some CreativeWork
      - A firstAppearance that indicates the first known occurrence of a Claim in some CreativeWork
    - Can take the form of an array of claims
  - spatialCoverage
    - The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork takes the place(s) which are the focus of the content
    - A spatialCoverage may take an array of [Place](https://schema.org/Place) when the scope of spatialCoverage includes more than one Place
    - A Place, in turn, takes a name, a description and a [geo](https://schema.org/geo)
    - A geo, in turn, takes:
      - [GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates) and/or
      - [GeoShape](https://schema.org/GeoShape)
    - Use [additionalProperty](https://schema.org/additionalProperty) to identify the spatial reference system (e.g. WGS84). See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-reference-systems) for an example
  - temporalCoverage
    - temporalCoverage is expressed in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format
  - distribution
    - A downloadable form of this dataset, at a specific location, in a specific format. This property can be repeated if different variations are available. There is no expectation that different downloadable distributions must contain exactly equivalent information. Different distributions might include or exclude different subsets of the entire dataset, for example
    - Takes either a [DataDownload](https://schema.org/DataDownload) or a [SearchAction](https://schema.org/SearchAction)
      - Takes a DataDownLoad when a distribution can be retrieved by a url. See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#distributions) for an example
      - Takes a SearchAction when the distribution is retrieved through a service [endpoint](https://schema.org/EntryPoint) that takes [query parameters](https://schema.org/PropertyValueSpecification). See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#accessing-data-through-a-service-endpoint) for an example
  - variableMeasured
