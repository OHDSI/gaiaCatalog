- [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset) has...
  - standard properties including name, description, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished, expires, license, [citation](https://schema.org/citation), version, [keywords](https://schema.org/keywords), [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique), [measurementMethod](https://schema.org/measurementMethod), creator, funder and provider
  - mainEntity
    - Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork
    - Has a controlled vocabulary: "Place", "Person", "Household", "Establishment", "Entangled"
  - includedInDataCatalog
    - A data catalog which contains this dataset
    - Our data catalog is named the GaiaCatalog
  - isBasedOn
    - A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaptation
    - Can take the form of an array of resources
    - See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#indicating-a-source-dataset-schemaisbasedon-and-provwasderivedfrom) for an example
  - subjectOf
    - A [Claim](https://schema.org/Claim) about this Thing
    - Think of the Claim(s) a Dataset makes as its hypotheses. Minimally, a claim has...
      - An appearance that indicates an occurrence of a Claim in some CreativeWork
      - A firstAppearance that indicates the first known occurrence of a Claim in some CreativeWork
    - Can take the form of an array of claims
  - spatialCoverage
    - The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork takes the place(s) which are the focus of the content
    - A spatialCoverage may take an array of [Place](https://schema.org/Place) when the scope of spatialCoverage includes more than one Place
    - A Place, in turn, takes minimally a name, a description and a [geo](https://schema.org/geo)
    - A geo, in turn, takes:
      - [GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates) (See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#use-geocoordinates-for-point-locations) for an example) and/or
      - [GeoShape](https://schema.org/GeoShape) (See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#use-geoshape-for-all-other-location-types) for an example)
    - Use [additionalProperty](https://schema.org/additionalProperty) to identify the spatial reference system (e.g. WGS84). See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-reference-systems) for an example
  - temporalCoverage
    - temporalCoverage is expressed in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format
  - distribution
    - A downloadable form of this dataset, at a specific location, in a specific format. This property can be repeated if different variations are available. There is no expectation that different downloadable distributions must contain exactly equivalent information. Different distributions might include or exclude different subsets of the entire dataset, for example
    - Takes either a [DataDownload](https://schema.org/DataDownload) or a [SearchAction](https://schema.org/SearchAction)
      - Takes a DataDownLoad when a distribution can be retrieved by a url. See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#distributions) for an example
      - Takes a SearchAction when the distribution is retrieved through a service [endpoint](https://schema.org/EntryPoint) that takes [query parameters](https://schema.org/PropertyValueSpecification). See [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#accessing-data-through-a-service-endpoint) for an example
  - variableMeasured
    - Takes an array of [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) following the [recommendation](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#tier-2-names-of-variables-with-formal-property-types) of [science-on-schema-org](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#describing-a-dataset)
    - Each PropertyValue in the array corresponds to an exposure definition
    - Each PropertyValue includes one or more propertyIDs. A [propertyID](https://schema.org/propertyID) corresponds to a concept_id in an external vocabulary
    - Each PropertyValue includes an [AddAction](https://schema.org/AddAction) potentialAction through which an external exposure occurrence is added to the external_exposure OMOP CDM table
    - Each PropertyValue takes an analysisRole from a controlled vocabulary that includes "Independent", "Dependent", "Intervening" and "Control"
    - Not all PropertyValues are enumerated -- just the "main" ones
      - In a Dataset each variable measured aka PropertyValue may occur in a time series
      - Think of the "main" ones as exposure definition templates
      - Each template can be specialized to create exposures in the time series in which an exposure defintion participates
